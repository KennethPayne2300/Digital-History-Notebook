She mainly was the one that saw potential in the analytical engine proposing that it could do way more than just calculation. She Collaborated with charles babbage granting her a lot of computing "firsts". When she translated a transcript from french, that was originally by a prime minister of italy, she added some notes that explained the analytical engine. She made a hypothetical program in the last note of the transcript, giving her the title after death of the first computer programmer.
