# Alan Turing

Alan Turing made the universal turing machine to try and solve the Entscheidungsproblem, a mathematical problem that stumped mathmeticians at that time. This was the start of all physical computers, not just theoretical. They soon determined that not all mathematical problems can't be done by an algorithm, creating the church-turing thesis, framing our understanding of what can be computed. During WW2 he decoded german intelegence.
