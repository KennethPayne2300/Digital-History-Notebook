# Bill Gates

Bill gates saw the altair 8800 and made code for a BASIC interpreter by making an emulator of the altair 8800, because he didn't have an actual altair 8800. soon after the code was widely distributed, and he wrote a letter the the masses saying that you should pay if you want quality programming. he soon transferred the 86-dos for IBMs newest computer at the time, the IBM PC. He made the first retail version of windows in 1985, to keep the competition from apple from getting too heated fast.
