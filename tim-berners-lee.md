# Tim Berners Lee

Tim Berners Lee (TimBL) was working at CERN when making the World Wide Web (www) in 1989. It was originally made for faster and automated information sharing between scientists worldwide. He made it due to his boss giving him time to work on it, even though it wasn't an official CERN project, he also used his neXT computer. He made 3 things to make up the web: HTML, URI, and HTTP, each of these were essential in the web for http helped retrieve the HTML, the HTML for formating, and the URI is like the url we use today, but its a broader term.
